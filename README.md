# RedBall_2d
This is a fun, lightweight 2D game developed using the Unity engine inspired by the original Red Ball game. The player navigates a red ball through three levels, each increasing difficulty and introducing new challenges. The game includes interactive buttons allowing easy level selection, restarting, or pausing.
